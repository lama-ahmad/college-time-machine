        <h3>Intended Experience</h3>

        <p>College Time Machine is a whimsical way to explore information about U.S. Colleges. 
        The current intended experience is for the user to be able to explore how certain data points 
        (tuition, racial demographics) have changed over the years.</p>

        <h3>Motivation + Process</h3>
        
        <p>I wanted to work with data from the U.S. Department of Education, and I was most inspired 
        by the College Scorecard API. Looking at data can often be thought of as a boring or clinical process,
        especially when it relates to topics such as education.</p>

        <p>I decided to also use the Wayback Machine API to look at the historical web pages of college institutions 
        at specific points in time. This is where the idea of a time machine came about.</p>

        <p>By putting these two API's together, I created a software Mashup that brings a new experience to exploring
        data about college in the U.S. It is simultaneously a feeling of going back in time through the WayBack machine,
        the selection of years, and the Time Machine character on the page, as well as exploring historical data about
        U.S. collegs in a comparative perspective.</p>

        <h3>Explanation of the design decisions</h3>

        <i>Time Machine Personality</i>

        <p>To create the whimsical feeling at the same time as exploring data, I added a time machine image in the
        center of the page. Because the rest of the design is minimalistic, the time machine is the focal point of the page. 
        The user needs to click on the time machine to trigger the search process. Blinking lights on the time machine indicate 
        loading. If there is an error or clarification needed, the text seems to come from the time machine as a character.
        The font ‘Courier’ looks like a the font that is on the detailing of the time machine image as well to create a cohesive 
        feeling on the page.</p>
        
        <i>Side by side comparison of two years</i>
        
        <p>In the first version of my project, I did not display two side by side comparisons of different years. The idea of displaying 
        a side by side comparison came about when I conducted user testing. Users often wanted to see how data points compared across
        different years, so I decided to build the functionality in from the beginning.</p>
        
        <i>The Use of the Word College</i>
        
        <p>Although college is not a word used to describe university-level education on a global level, I wanted to make it clear that 
        the search function would only include universities in the United States.</p>
        
        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p>The JSON format from the College Score Card API changes at different dates. For example, racial demographic data has 
        different keys at different points in time. Thus, I addressed this by limiting my scope of years from 2010 to 2016 although
        the College Score Card API has data from 1996 to 2016. In a future version, I can add on earlier years to deal with the differences 
        in the JSON formatting.</p>

        <p>Another challenge that I faced was creating a search functionality. Because some colleges have branches or similar names, there would 
        often be multiple results for one search. I addressed this by adding the “Please Specify” input box that pops up if there is more than 
        one matching result according to the keyword typed in.</p>
        

        <h3>Possible next steps</h3>

        <p>To take this a step further, it would be interesting to create some data visualizations. I could also add more data points and allow the 
        user to decide on which data points specifically they would like to see.</p>
